So, I have finally actually rebuilt my website with Astro, so I may as well do a blog post about how I deploy it.
If you are expecting something sensible and boring like GitHub actions, sorry to disappoint, but like, it's me, you can't have been expecting that right?

And so, our hero, Capistrano returns to once again allow me to do silly things with Rake files. I will split this up into two parts, the first the Emacs configuration deployment, followed by the tasks to deploy my website.

##### Emacs Deployment:
Slight variations from last time, no more SSRI :(

As always, starting with <ins>hooks.rake</ins>

```ruby hooks.rake
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

before 'deploy:starting', :uptime
before 'deploy:starting', :gitpush

after 'deploy:updated', :cpPrebuild
```
<br/>

The tasks <ins>:uptime</ins> and <ins>:gitpush</ins> have both stayed the same as last time, so you can view the last blog post for those [here](/blog/posts/emacsconfonmywebsite/).
<ins>:cpPrebuild</ins> is called after deploying the emacs configuration files to my server, and it copies the files into the directory where the latest release from my website resides. 
```ruby cpPrebuild.rake
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

newarray=%w{config.el packages.el init.el};
desc "Copies files to webserver"
task :cpPrebuild do
  on roles(:all) do |host|
    newarray.each do |file|
      info "Copying #{file}"
      dirPath ="#{release_path}/#{file}"
      execute :cp, "#{dirPath}", "/var/www/mahoosively.gay/public_html/astroSite/cap/current/public/codeFiles/emacsConfFiles"
    end
  end
  invoke(:yarnBuild)
end
```
<br />
We can see that <ins>:yarnBuild</ins> is invoked once the files have been copied across. This simply runs <ins>yarn build</ins> in the release directory.
``` ruby yarnBuild.rake
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

desc "Runs ssri"
task :yarnBuild do
  on roles(:all) do |host|
    info "Running yarb on #{host}"
    within "/var/www/mahoosively.gay/public_html/astroSite/cap/current/" do
      info "Building in /var/www/mahoosively.gay/public_html/astroSite/cap/current/"
      execute :yarn, "run", "build"
    end
  end
  invoke(:cpCurrentReleaseToPM2Dir)
end
```
<br />
You may be wondering why I didn't run <ins>yarn install</ins> first; that will have already been done when the website was deployed, you can see this later.
Finally, we invoke <ins>:cpCurrentReleaseToPM2Dir</ins>, which does the same as the task of the same name, explained under the website section, so for now just roll with it.

``` ruby cpCurrentReleaseToPM2Dir.rake
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

desc "Copies files to right location for pm2 to use"
task :cpCurrentReleaseToPM2Dir do
  on roles(:all) do |host|
      dirPath ="/var/www/mahoosively.gay/public_html/astroSite/cap/current/."
      execute :cp, "-a",  "#{dirPath}", "/var/www/mahoosively.gay/public_html/astroSite/pm2Dir"
  end
end
```
<br />
Okay, onto the website side of things!

##### Website Deployment:
Could I have just used git, and like, cloned the repo? Yeah totally, but that got boring - I don't recommend doing this lol.

Anyway, with that disclaimer, I am initally going to explain a little about how the website is run before going over how I used Capistrano to do this for me.

So, this website is run with a node server, super basic, basically copied and pasted directly out of Astro's docs:
```sh
HOST=0.0.0.0 PORT=4321 node ./dist/server/entry.mjs
```
<br />
Cool, that starts node fine, but like, that's localhost. 
So we also want to proxy my domain through to node - for this I am using Apache, pretty simple. 
Finally, how do we, like, start this after a reboot? I don't wanna log in and run...
```sh
screen -X HOST=0.0.0.0 PORT=4321 node ./dist/server/entry.mjs
```
<br />
...every time I reboot my webserver.

So, thankfully, <ins>pm2</ins> exists - this allows me to have a daemon that runs node with the above arguments.

```sh
pm2 start "HOST=0.0.0.0 PORT=4321 node ./dist/server/entry.mjs" --name mainwebsite && pm2 save && pm2 startup
```
<br />

The thing to keep in mind, is that on boot this will be run in the directory that you were in when you ran <ins>pm2 start</ins>.
Hence, we need to make sure Capistrano deploys to the same place each time - surely that's easy, Capistrano makes a symlinked folder <ins>current</ins> which points to the most recent deployment.
Okay, well, like, that should be easy right - just start <ins>pm2</ins> in the <ins>current</ins> directory. 
Sadly, no, not that easy. <ins>pm2</ins> does not work with symlinks like that, and will keep using the previous release, even if the symlink changes to point to a newer release, even if you restart the node server.
Well, damn, okay, we need to make sure we copy the current release into another directory, which is where we can run <ins>pm2</ins> from - it is more than happy to hot reload files themselves, just not symlinked files.

Now you might see why I didn't cover that in the Emacs section lol - anyway, I am getting ahead of myself a bit here, lets start at the start:

Of course, that means we start at <ins>hooks.rake</ins>
```ruby hooks.rake
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
before 'deploy:starting', :gitCommitUpdate

before 'deploy:symlink:release', :cpEmacsFiles
after 'deploy:symlink:release', :yarnInstall
after 'deploy:symlink:release', :yarnBuild
after 'deploy:symlink:release', :cpCurrentReleaseToPM2Dir
```
<br />
<ins>:gitCommitUpdate</ins> is honestly, super janky because I am lazy, please just don't do this lol

``` ruby gitCommitUpdate.rake
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

desc 'Pull repo, commit any changes, asking for commit message, then push'
task :gitCommitUpdate do
  ask(:gitCommitMsg, prompt:"Please enter your commit message")
     run_locally do
       info "#{capture(:whoami)}  #{fetch(:gitCommitMsg)}"
       execute "git commit -a -m \"#{fetch(:gitCommitMsg)}\""
       execute "git pull"
       execute "git push"
     end
end
```
<br />

Yes, this does not work if there are no changes in the repository, no it isn't good, yes I am an idiot, don't use it, you've been warned.

Anyway, on it goes, until before Capistrano symlinks the newest release to the 'current' dir. Here <ins>:cpEmacsFiles</ins> is called, which simply copies the most recent release from the Emacs deployment folder to the release folder - this means that I can update the Emacs files and my website separately, without needing to worry about rebuilding anything myself. 
``` ruby cpEmacsFiles.rake
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

newarray=%w{config.el packages.el init.el};
desc "Copies files to webserver"
task :cpEmacsFiles do
  on roles(:all) do |host|
    newarray.each do |file|
      info "Copying #{file}"
      dirPath ="/var/www/mahoosively.gay/public_html/emacsConfig/current/#{file}"
      execute :cp, "#{dirPath}", "#{release_path}/public/codeFiles/emacsConfFiles"
    end
  end
end
```
<br />

This should be pretty self explanatory, it is basically the same as what we did in the Emacs deployment.

Once symlinking has been done, we need to install <ins>yarn</ins>:

```ruby yarnInstall.rake

desc "install yarn in current release dir"
task :yarnInstall do
  on roles(:all) do |host|
    within "#{release_path}" do
      info "Installing yarn in #{capture(:pwd)}"
      execute :yarn, "install"
    end
  end
end
```
<br />

This just builds yarn in the release directory. Likewise, we need to build yarn in the release directory:

```ruby yarnBuild

desc "Build dist in current release dir"
task :yarnBuild do
  on roles(:all) do |host|
    within "#{release_path}" do
      info "Building in #{release_path}"
      execute :yarn, "run", "build"
    end
  end
end
```
<br />

Once that has been done, we just need to copy the files into the directory where <ins>pm2</ins> was run/is running from:

```ruby cpCurrentReleaseToPM2Dir
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

desc "Copies files to right location for pm2 to use"
task :cpCurrentReleaseToPM2Dir do
  on roles(:all) do |host|
      dirPath ="#{release_path}/."
      execute :cp, "-a",  "#{dirPath}", "/var/www/mahoosively.gay/public_html/astroSite/pm2Dir"
  end
end
```
<br />

And that should be it! By no means is it good, but I am lazy, and it works for me to just be able to run...
```shell
bundle exec cap prod deploy
```
<br />
... and have my website build and deploy itself, or update the emacs configuration files on my website.

Thanks for reading!
