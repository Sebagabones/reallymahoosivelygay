    <h3>An about me:</h3>

    <p>
        Heya! I'm Seb, and my pronouns are they/them.
        I'm studying
        computer science at UWA, and this is my attempt at a (low effort) personal website.
    </p>
    <h4>Interests</h4>
    <p>
        So, in case it wasn't obvious, I kinda enjoy messing around with computers. I am very much the stereotypical
        Linux user, and while I do enjoy making things "pretty" (I mean, I <i>am</i> a contributor to Catppuccin), I
        usually
        enjoy High Performance Computing (multithreading my beloved), messing with Asynchronous anything, Data
        Formatting/Collection/Pipelining and automating anything I can (I have 100%
        spent
        more time automating something than it would have taken to just do it manually). I also go crazy for
        anything with
        Linux (the more absurd the better). I am also currently (2024) the Vice-President of the <a
            href="https://ucc.asn.au">University Computer Club</a> and take great joy in the amount of
        <s>sensible</s> projects the club gets up to (ask me about Coffinfish sometime!). Outside of that, I enjoy
        riding motorcycles and bicycles, and listening to music - to see what I am currently listening to, and the
        20
        songs I have played the most in recent history, click <a href="spotifySongs">here</a> (if you want to see how I did this, a write-up is in my blog). I use Emacs (because of course I do), and you can see my configuration files <a href="emacsFiles">here</a>.

    </p>

        <h4>Skills</h4>
        <p>
            I am proficient in using Python and C/C++, and I enjoyed Java when I last used it in uni. Sadly, I have
            written a bunch of code
            in JavaScript (including a <s>lovely</s> flavour called Google Apps Script), and so I am perfectly happy
            to
            write code in that, although I do prefer Typescript. If I am forced to write a bash script, I will
            unironically use Amber instead, until it doesn't work lol. I have used SQL,
            and obviously I can use HTML and CSS lol, and I have used vanilla React by itself before (parts of this
            website do actually use pure React! For example, <a href="spotifySongs">here</a>). I lightly used
            some frameworks before, in the form of RedwoodJS and a tad of Deno.
            I have also used a little bit of Ruby, and have used Rake files before, and found them fun.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am perfectly comfortable using Numpy and Matplotlib in Python, and I have done network programming, as
            well as using MPICH and OpenMP for multi-threading and multi-node computing in C/C++, and enjoyed it
            immensely. I also quite like messing around with Pulumi for automating infrastucture creation, and I
            have
            had a heap of fun using Capistrano to automate deploying parts of this website (read about that <a
                href="/blog/posts/emacsconfonmywebsite">here</a>)
        </p>
        <p>I am <i>incredibly</i> at ease at using the command line on Unix systems lol - I am not exaggerating when
            I
            say I am more comfortable and proficient at using (and fixing/trouble shooting) Linux systems compared
            to
            Windows systems. I take great
            joy in running the most cooked and cursed setups as my daily driver, and I am currently using Bedrock
            Linux
            with an EndeavourOS stratum and an Alpine Linux stratum </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Server Side Rendered Includes (SSRI), a web templating framework I built inspired by Apache
                    Server Side Includes. I have a lot to ramble about with it, so the entry here is short, but if
                    you want to read more about it, the write up of it is <a href=ssri>here</a>,
                    and the

                </li>
                <li>
                    A RedwoodJS website for better management of <a href="https://ucc.asn.au">UCC</a>'s member VM's,
                    replacing the Proxmox UI. This started out as a Pulumi project to speed up VM creation, and
                    while there may still be part of that in the CI side of it, I am now planning to probably try to
                    just use the Proxmox API.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Theming for KDE's Labplot, to add Catppuccin themes to it - this will hopefully be finished
                    soon<sup>tm</sup>. In true fashion, it all works, I am just running into the classic issue where
                    finishing the last 10% of the documentation is harder than the rest of it was. If you want to
                    try it out,
                    my repository is <a href=https://github.com/Sebagabones/labplot>here</a>

                    The <a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/vimium">Vimium Catppuccin port</a> which I maintain
                    (which, to be honest, has needed very little maintenance so far).

            <ul>
                <li>
                    My current daily driver is (sadly) not very exciting from a hardware perspective - it is an Asus
                    Zenbook 13, which has me trapped in its OLED clutches. However, finding the hardware too
                    sensible for my standards, my solution was to make the Operating System as cursed as possible,
                    which is how I wound up running <a href="https://bedrocklinux.org/">Bedrock Linux</a> with an
                    EndeavourOS stratum along with an Alpine Linux stratum (and I have also installed the Nix
                    package
                    manager too of course). This has a <i>very</i> Catppuccin themed i3 setup, although sadly
                    overall it mostly "just works<sup>tm</sup>" too often for my liking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An X270 thinkpad that is running FreeBSD, which I have been slowly
                    upgrading with a new IPS FHD screen, new larger batteries, a 1TB
                    Samsung M.2 SSD and 16GB of ram. Alas, after writing some incredibly fun scripts to avoid the
                    forsaken
                    BD-PROCHOT, I have pretty much stopped using it lol.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An x201 thinkpad that is running Alpine Linux with i3 (yes I know -
                    I'm falling down the rabbit hole even more) - this has been upgraded
                    as far as it can go (8 GB of ram let's go). This has also been phased out of regular use, mostly
                    due to
                    the screen being borderline painful to use.
                </li>

                <li>
                    An IBM x3200 M3 server (<a href="bonescallhome">bonescallhome</a>) which is no longer
                    hosting
                    this
                    webpage - in fact, this is no longer even at my house! I found it too sensible, and so in true
                    fashion
                    for myself, I gave it to a friend.
                </li>

                <li>
                    An IBM x3550 M4 server (<a href="bonesrunhome">bonesrunhome</a>)
                    which is running a few VMs (including a debian VM which is dedicated
                    to web-hosting)
                </li>

                <li>
                    A project that has now been put on the back burner: a Toshiba T3200 -
                    this has a whopping 4MBs of ram, with a 40MB hard drive. Currently it
                    isn't booting, and so my focus is to fix/replace the floppy disk drive
                    (this is very much on the back burner on account of it now no longer
                    turning on lol - unsure why, but it seems I may have let the magic
                    smoke out- hopefully I'll fix it one day)
                </li>
                <li>
                    A ThinkPad 770z running Tiny Core Linux. This has had it's hard drive (an IBM <s>Deskstar</s>
                    Deathstar
                    that had started rattling) replaced with an SD card, and was an adventure in finding a Distro
                    that
                    supported such an old CPU. I setup some sort of window manager on it, iirc IceWM, and have
                    promptly
                    not
                    used it since.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An IBM x3650 M2 (<a href="bonescrawlhome">bonescrawlhome</a>). This is not and will never
                    be
                    used -
                    if you live in perth and want it please let me know lol.

                <li>

                    <a href="Power7"> Power 750 Express.</a>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <a href="bonesboundhome">bonesboundhome</a> an IBM x3650 M4 that is running as my secondary

                </li>

                <li>
                    I also have an IBM bladecenter H, but I have no idea what I will ever
                    use it for - this may be destined to die a horrible death soon, mostly due to the fact that <a
                        href="https://ucc.asn.au">UCC</a> tries to
                    murder me whenever it starts up.
