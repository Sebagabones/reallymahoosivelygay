			I was just going to link to the pdf itself, however I realised wanted to talk about the report itself too
			lmao. If you just want to see the report, it's available <a
				href="/theIdioticTimeDistributionOfAReport.pdf"> here</a> (with my group-mate's name redacted as
			I haven't asked him for permission, along with both of our student ID's), otherwise, get ready for some
			rambling.
		</p>
		<p>
			Firstly, yes, I went <i>slightly</i> overkill with the Catppuccin theming, but I did really enjoy relearning
			Matplotlib (which, yes, was also themed lol).

				My workflow for this was <i>slightly</i> insane, as my group-mate, who was writing up the code
				implementation
				explanation
				did not want to learn Latex, and so I had to find a way to convert Markdown to Latex, while getting the
				theming to work properly.    <br />
				Thankfully, pandoc exists, and so<code><span class="sh">pandoc </span><span class="o">--listings </span> <span class="o">-f
				</span><span >markdown </span><span class="o">-t </span><span >latex </span><span class="o">-o </span>
				<span >report.tex report.md </span></code>
			</p>

			<p>
				Ironically, I didn't actually use
				<ins>listings</ins> in the end report, as I found the <ins>minted</ins> package with <a
					href="https://pygments.org/">Pygments</a> to work a bit better,
				and (importantly) already had a Catppuccin theme! So, the next step was to (tediously) go through the
				generated tex file, replacing every <ins>listed</ins>
				call with an equivalent <ins>minted</ins> version (a rough example would be to replace
				<code><span class="k">\passthrough</span><span class="nb">{</span><span class="k">\lstinline</span> !make release! <span class="nb">}</span></code>
				with
				<code><span></span><span class="k">\textbf</span><span class="nb"></span><span class="k">\mintinline</span><span class="nb"></span> bash<span class="nb"></span>make release<span class="nb"></span></code>).
				Also, huge thank you to Yukai Chou, who wrote a lovely latex function I borrowed to get some parts of
				minted
				to work (code <a href="https://github.com/gpoore/minted/issues/288#issuecomment-1501540637"> here</a>)!

			Once this, and the rest of the small things needed to touch up the document (so many things) had been done,
			I could then
			simply generate a pdf from the tex file using
			<code> <span class="sh">pdflatex</span><span class="o"> --shell-escape </span> <span> report.tex</span> </code>. If you want to see what my tex file looked like at the end
			of it all, I have attached it <a href="/theDreadedTexFile.tex">here</a>.

			You may be wondering, surely this must have taken hours, just to get a nice colour-scheme on a report... and
			you would be right to wonder, I genuinely do not know why I put myself through this. On the upside, I guess
			I get to ramble about it here, and we <i>did</i> get a good grade for presentation (to be honest, we got
			100% in the entire assessment, so I am going to tell myself without the theming we might have only got 14/15
			or something). Oh, and no, the hours spent do not include setting up Matplotlib to produce graphs that
			matched the colour-scheme
			- that actually wasn't too bad, and using Matplotlib was easier for me because it meant I was able to create
			the graphs using code,
			which worked well for my brain lol.
